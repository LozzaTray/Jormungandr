% This is a template to be used for the preparation of
% papers submitted to the 34th International Workshop on
% Statistical Modelling, to be held in Trieste, Italy,
% July 18-22, 2022.

% Please follow the following general guidelines:
%
% (1) Do not specify any definitions, commands or style parameters.
%     Upon submission, your file will be checked for presence of
%     \newcommand or \def statements and if found, error message will be reported
%     by the submission form.
%
% (2) Follow the template below very tightly.
%
% (3) Include .pdf figures using the \includegraphics
%      command, an example of which are given below.
%
% (4) Use file names which begin with the surname of the first author.
%
% (5) When creating labels for cross-references, please start always
%     by surname of the first author, e.g., \label{smith:likelihood}
%
% (6) The template below contains some example materials
%      to guide you through the preparation of your paper.  However,
%      remove all the redundant material from your final document
%      before submitting.

% The guidelines above are needed in order to be able to combine all
% the papers into a single proceedings book of acceptable quality.
% Please follow the guidelines as strictly as possible. Deviations may
% result in papers being either refused by the registration form
% or sent back to the authors with the request to change
% their documents according to the guidelines.

% Special characters:
% Please do not use special characters (e.g., accents).
% Use TeX composition instead, such as \~n, \'a, \`e, \v{s}, \r{u} etc.

% Changes as of IWSM 2013:
%  * \usepackage{booktabs} added which allows \toprule et al. in the tabular environment
%    (\hline\hline is not longer used)
%  * '^\T' added in iwsm.sty to denote transposed vectors and matrices within math (see example below)
%  * \usepackage{amsmath, amssymb} introduced since IWSM 2012 is allowed (allowing usage of boldsymbols
%    and other handy constructions (align, pmatrix etc.) within math)
%  * \usepackage{psfrag} introduced since IWSM 2012 is NOT allowed
