\section{Feature-First Block Model}

We propose a novel generative model for labelled networks -- which we call the feature-first block model (FFBM),
illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:ffbm}.
Let $N$ denote the number of vertices, $B$ the number of blocks
and $D$ the number of features associated with each vertex.
We write $X$ for the $N\times D$ {\em feature matrix} containing
the feature vectors $\{x_i\}_{i=1}^{N}$ 
as its rows.
%
For the FFBM, we start with the feature matrix $X$ and generate a random
vector of block memberships $b \in [B]^N$ -- noting the notation $[K] = \{1, 2 \dots K\}$. For each vertex $i$, the
block membership $b_i\in[B]$ is generated based on the feature
vector $x_i$, independently between vertices, 
$p(b| X, \theta) = \prod_{i \in [N]} \phi_{b_i} (x_i; \theta)$.

Once the block memberships $b$ have been generated, we then draw the 
adjacency matrix of the graph, $A$, from the microcanonical DC-SBM, Peixoto (2017), with additional parameters 
$\psi$,
$
	A \sim \textrm{DC-SBM}_{\textrm{MC}} (b, \psi).

$
Priors on the parameters $\theta$ and $\psi$ are chosen to complete the Bayesian framework.
